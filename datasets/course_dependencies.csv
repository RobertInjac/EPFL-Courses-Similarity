Concepts such as commensurability or symmetry will be placed in the context of both disciplines by examining texts and demonstrations. Moreover, this course supposes a very strong homology between geometrical theorems and the associative and parametric project. One like the other need an explicit definition of a hypothesis from which variable consequences can be deduced out of the modification of its initial data. This course is therefore an introduction to the parametrical culture, which will be explored even more in the 2nd year in the digital stereotomy course, and in 3rd year as a baccking course to the construction course."

2,AR-402(y),Studio MA2 (Huang),Théorie et critique du projet MA2 (Huang),"The advent of new digital technologies has had a twofold impact on architectural thinking and urban design, transforming, on one hand, the processes for form generation and design production through algorithmic and parametric technologies, and, on the other hand, enabling an escape from the static fate of the built environment by facilitating dynamic interaction between inhabitants and their surrounding. Our interest in the orientation &#8220<semicolon/>Form + Type&#8221<semicolon/> is to explore meaningful form generating processes by the use of algorithmic and parametric tools and introduce the notion of digital vernacular in architectural and urban design thinking. In particular, we examine the potential of responsive morphogenetic design to explore intuitive form finding processes that address bio-climatic and socio-economic challenges. This Spring studio (the ""Xixinan Spring Studio"") builds on our fall studio, and explores in depth and at a finer architectural resolution the site-specific interventions in Xixinan, taking into account the material ecology, digital fabrication and traditional skills, off-site and on-site assembly, with a view to possibly realize a 1:1 prototype on site. The intellectual aim of the studio is to question the extent to which the data-scape can artificially generate architectural and constructive form. Our interest is directed at the decoding and recoding of two distinct domains of knowledge: exteriority which represents a many-layered geographic condition and anteriority which represents the embedded knowledge of local architectural typologies and systems. While the exteriority of geographic data is crucial to our research, we place a primary emphasis on the generative potential of typology- what we have called ""growth typologies"". Decoding anterior form and then recoding and deploying it across new territories allows us to challenge the role of architecture in urban developments of increased scale and complexity.","This studio explores meaningful form generating processes by the use of parametric tools and introduces the notion of the digital vernacular in architectural and urban design thinking.

8,AR-485,,Political Economy of Design,"By integrating yet moving beyond the stylistic, technological or sociological aspects of the discipline, the discussion reviews the industrial elements that are likely to affect programmatic objectives, formal directions and technical outcomes of building projects. Such discussion has a strong comparative bent, and is coloured by the notion of innovation - what it means from a social, technical and cultural point of view, and how it enters and affects different building markets. Attention is directed at understanding the distinction between innovation on one side and invention and technological change on the other. In this context, architecture<squote/>s connection with planning and building disciplines is examined and criticised in the attempt to formulate a strategic framework for its use as an environmental policy instrument.","Political Economy of Design seeks to position and discuss architecture in relation to the world of production, economic interests and community benefits, at a local and global scale.",Benefits from,AR-487,,Technological Innovation,"Technological Innovation has three aims.

Remark The student must download and complete the form &#8220<semicolon/>Lab immersion in academia&#8221<semicolon/> (http://sv.epfl.ch/masters_en<semicolon/> see Forms) and submit it to the SV Section (SSV). The form must be approved and signed by an EPFL supervising professor and the SSV section director. 1. Before you undertake a 22-credit lab immersion outside EPFL, you must identify an &#8220<semicolon/>EPFL mentor"" who will approve your proposed project, follow your progress, and assign the grades for your work. The mentor must be an EPFL professor (PATT, PA, or PO) who is affiliated with the SV section (SSV). 2. Before you undertake a 22-credit lab immersion outside EPFL your project must be approved by the SSV section. The process is straightforward: first, download the project proposal form from http://sv.epfl.ch/master_en (under &#8220<semicolon/>FORMS&#8221<semicolon/>)<semicolon/> second, fill out the form<semicolon/> third, have the form signed by the student and the EPFL mentor<semicolon/> fourth, submit the signed form to the EPFL-SSV section director for approval. You may not leave EPFL until your project has been approved. 3. Each 22-credit lab immersion is divided into two 11-credit blocks (""block A"" and ""block B""). Each 11-credit block will be graded separately. However, both blocks must be taken together<semicolon/> you may not take just one 11-credit block. The 22-credit lab immersion is considered to be ""full time"" during the semester. 4. You may do either a 22-credit lab immersion in industry or a 22-credit lab immersion in academia but you may not do both. In other words: you may do only one 22-credit lab immersion outside EPFL. 5. The courses &#8220<semicolon/>SHS: Introduction to the project&#8221<semicolon/> (fall semester) and &#8220<semicolon/>SHS: Project&#8221<semicolon/> (spring semester) must be completed before beginning the Master thesis project. Thus, if a student does a 22-credit lab immersion outside EPFL before the second year of the Master cycle this will delay completion of the Master cycle by at least one semester. 6. External Master students must validate at least 90 ECTS credits within EPFL. This implies that external Master students may do a 22-credit lab immersion outside EPFL or a 30-credit Master thesis project outside EPFL but they may not do both."

How to make sense of such tremendous volume of data? Developing effective techniques to extract meaningful information from large-scale and high-dimensional dataset has become essential for the success of business, government and science. Objective The goal of this course is to provide a broad introduction to effective algorithms in data science and network analysis. A major effort will be given to show that existing data analysis techniques can be defined and enhanced on graphs. Graphs encode complex structures like cerebral connection, stock exchange, and social network. Strong mathematical tools have been developed based on linear and non-linear graph spectral harmonic analysis to advance the standard data analysis algorithms. Main topics of the course are networks, unsupervised and supervised learning, recommendation, visualization, sparse representation, multi-resolution analysis, neuron network, and large-scale computing. Structure The course is organized into two parts: lectures (2 hours) and coding exercises (1 hour). The essential objective of the exercises is to apply the theory on real-world cases. Evaluation Evaluation will be conducted on a continuous basis: homeworks and coding assignments. Bio Prof. Pierre Vandergheynst: Full professor of EE and CS.

154,HUM-239,Psychology of emotion,Psychologie des émotions,"The subject beyond thought: ""I"", emotions and body Since Descartes, the subject has been identified to a disembodied thought, ruled by rationality. Since a few decades, this representation is changing. Psychologists, neuroscientists and philosophers consider the body as playing a central role in cognition. As a consequence, the conception of the thinking subject, fighting against his emotions, is about to disappear. Affects, as corporeal determinants, are now considered as playing a key role in decision making and the way behaviors are adapted to the surrounding, be it physical or social. From this embodied conception of the subject, this course will reconsider the psychological subject and what fund his sense of self. In exploring the conscious and unconscious mechanisms determining human actions, the neurological and cognitive impairments that modify psychological experiences, we will address whether the subject still can be thought of as a free, unified and rational subject.","We will teach basic knowledge on cognition and emotion from a mainly psychological perspective.

The three topics concerned benevolent deeds undertaken beyond national frontiers on behalf of individuals, communities, groups or entire nations in dire straits by a variety of actors (i.e. organizations governmental and non-governmental associations, philanthropic foundations).They will be examined bearing in mind local, international, and global contexts. The course will focus on humanitarian, global health and development actors (non-governmental organizations such as Médecins sans Frontière<semicolon/> international organizations<semicolon/> philanthropic organizations, for example the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). We will visit some of these institutions. We will also study these actors<squote/> tools, such as photography, movie, mass campaign vaccinations. We will pay attention to conflict and post-conflict, imperial/colonial and post-colonial periods, during which development became a politically, economically, and socially relevant international issue. The course draws attention to the importance of historical perspectives, showing that global health or humanitarian operations or development projects are not inventions of the post-Cold War period but have a longer history. Our aim is to show continuities and ruptures between then and now. Case studies will be favored in this class. The emphasis will also be put on extra-European countries. The course is organized in two parts: a first part, which provides a general overview of the topics, and a second part during which students work on their projects."
