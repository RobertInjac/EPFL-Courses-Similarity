The site will be in the alpine center of Europe where, increasingly, tourism is breaking out of its traditional boundaries. The focus is directed at the construction of ¿Gegenwelten¿, the spaces that are shaped by travelers, the local population and those who provide services, that area where wishes and needs must be created and simultaneously met. In the autumn semester we start the deep reading of the direct surrounding landscape and its cultural traces, which should result in constructive impulses to act. In the spring semester this will be followed by an astonishing but modest intervention in terms of adding, subtraction and transforming, considering all scales until the 1:1.

This twofold approach simultaneously enables to face the questions of conceptual, spatial and expressive cohesion and to explore ways of turning the sustainability challenges into a ""raw material"" for the architect. The particular aim is to study interactions between issues of density, mixed land use and quality of life, to design buildings that take into account the principles of bioclimatic architecture and to develop construction details in accordance with fundamental notions of sustainability. The project exercises are based on the search for creative solutions appropriate to the development of a dense and mixed urban site. They are worked out successively on the specific scale of the urban form, the district, the building and its component parts.",By an approach situated at different intervention levels - from urban design to constructive detail - the studio aims to explore the strategies of sustainable architecture to redirect urban development inward and to generate urban densification close to public transport.

Observation - rather than analyse - and imagination - rather than concept - are part of this approach. A strong belief in the variety of media - from handmade drawing to crafted modelling not only as a result but rather as an ongoing method - are the instruments on the table.

25,AR-301(b),Studio BA5 (Graf F.),Théorie et critique du projet BA5 (Graf F.),"Building in built structures is not a new practice, far from it. What turns it into a contemporary attitude, however, is the kind of theoretical and practical questioning about the architectural object at all its scales, as well as a closer look at the material character of the building, which both give rise to the project. The protection project calls for a number of rational and technical investigations which will at once yield knowledge of the object of the study and define the uses of potential work to be carried out. The documentation of the building will be compiled with the help of historical research and graphic and photographic records, of its construction process and its material character, and of its sensitive and sensual aspects. The heritage value of the building will be determined by placing it in its historical, architectural and urban context, in the work of the actors that designed and built it, as well as in terms of its role as an economic and social resource. An analysis of its functional and distribution capacities, of its constitution and physical characteristics will dictate its potentials in terms of utilisation, maintenance and restructuring. The protection project is a dual and inseparable project of conservation and renovation: the material substance of an existing building is conserved, preserved, reinforced, set off to advantage or returned to its original function, while at the same time something new is grafted onto this building to produce a prolongation of its life-cycle, a superimposition and juxtaposition of added elements. The project also concerns the reinforcement of a metal frame as well as the addition of a new functional body, and it focuses on the awareness of the relations and interfaces produced by their significance. The workshop thus aims to familiarise students with the theoretical and practical elements of the development of the discipline of this project: of this ""knowledge in action"". The object - and indeed the entirety - of this study and the subject of the project is linked to our daily heritage: that of the towns and countryside of post-war French-speaking Switzerland.",Work to be done on existing structures is a major stake in the development of the city of the 21st century.

The Berlin and Frankfurt Siedlungen, the large blocks in Hamburg or Amsterdam, the residential buildings of Stockholm<squote/>s or Copenhagen<squote/>s classicism, and the Wienerhöfe are both case studies and references. The design proposal is located every year in one of these cities, acting as an opportunity to get to know its urban structure and character. It will also address how collective housing can contribute to defining urban identity.

With the planning of a new academy building as an architectural school and exhibition centre we want both to continue the tradition and take into account the chance for renewal and innovation. Here it is important to find a synthesis of successive constructive systems, without falling into copy. It should also be created a relation between extreme functional purpose, historical quotation and poetical refinement. The new design of the building of the Bauakademie has to complement the adjacent urban renewal projects in Berlin Mitte. A field trip will take place in Berlin. (7.10-11.10.2016) The students will visit the site. The trip will focus on the work of K. F. Schinkel. The associated costs will amount to 300CHF. While the project during the autumn semester will deal with the complexity and program for an educational institution at an urban scale, we will transfer the same issues to a small art-school-studio as a testing ground during the second semester, which will result in a built 1:1 project.","The atelier will examine the programmatic and spatial organization of the Bauakademie in Berlin.

Space is back again at the centre of our preoccupations: as a support which defines conditions, which asks to renew the practice of the urban and territorial project, in between urban design, landscape urbanism, regional and environmental planning. In the common field of the city-territory a new approach must be imagined, starting from individual and collective practices, natural dynamics, rationalization processes. The Alps are a special context in Europe where to study the relation between artificial and natural rationalities. Climate change acts inside this context as a stressor and as a connector. The Alps are crucial in the European space<semicolon/> their modifications can affect territories wider than the Alps themselves. Following the main rivers from the alpine sources to the sea, connecting the upstream territory with the plain downstream can construct an ideal section through the European territory. Strategies of mitigation and adaptation to climate change can be the starting point to re-contextualise the Alps inside Europe and for designing innovative habitat. These are the tasks of the studio. New life-cycles will open up in the Alpine territory in relation to climate change: from the big hydraulic infrastructural works to face the flooding risk till the dismantling ski-resorts. In both cases the embodied energy in the territory is to be investigated and considered as &#8220<semicolon/>spatial capital&#8221<semicolon/> to be recycled in a new cycle, inside new social geographies.

39,AR-401(b),Studio MA1 (Gugger),Théorie et critique du projet MA1 (Gugger),"The Middle East was the birthplace of the Neolithic Revolution, the founding agricultural act that came to humanize and domesticate the planet. Bridging between Africa and Eurasia and pervaded by large rivers and marshlands, it contained a comparatively moist and fertile land. While climate changes during the Ice Age led to repeated extinction events, this region retained a greater amount of biodiversity than either Europe or North Africa, making it a crucial link in the distribution of Old World flora and fauna, including the spread of humanity. It is considered the Cradle of Civilization because it saw some of the very first developments in human social and technological inventions such as cities, class-based societies, monumental architecture, writing, the wheel, and irrigation. It was home to the eight Neolithic founder crops and four species of domesticated animals (cows, goats, sheep, and pigs). Aslo known as the Fertile Crescent, this region saw the onset of the human domination of nature and the birth of a long history of pastoral aesthetics. laba Studio 2016/17 will focus on Israel and the role played by agriculture in: 1) territorial appropriation and domestication<semicolon/> 2) structuring the development of urbanization<semicolon/> 3) creating a national homeland narrative<semicolon/> and 4) changing the climate. We will look into the three major types of Israeli agricultural development: the vernacular Palestinian/Bedouin, the socialist utopian Kibbutz/ Moshav, and the high-tech desert farming.The studio will be carried out in collaboration with Landbasics, a landscape architecture Master studio at the Technion headed by Prof. Matanya Sack.","laba<squote/>s focal theme is Urban Nature.

40,AR-401(c),Studio MA1 (Geers),Théorie et critique du projet MA1 (Geers),"After a full year of research into Metropolitan Architecture, this time Architecture without Content will tackle the Commons. In the wake of Brexit and the current soul searching inside the European continent about both the amplitude of its territory and the essence of its shared culture, this issue appears even more urgent than ever. Of all possible cases we decided to focus our attention this year on Italy, because exactly there for a certain period of time public architecture has been a constitutional part of its civilization<semicolon/> i.e. the Roman machine. During a few centuries the standard urban infrastructure of any given Roman city (the theatre, the market, the agora, the baths, the temples, the basilica, the markets, the schools, the legion<squote/>s headquarters and so forth) was in fact the essential spine of public life. This architecture thus allowed the very existence of the cities the way we got to know them. Since then, the Commons experienced ups and downs, were boosted by the pride of the city bourgeois in the Gothic cities, and were even carefully planned by the newly developed modern states. In the last century, both the totalitarian state and the welfare state, used the Commons to fulfill their own particular agenda thus producing the final incarnation of the Commons as a solid architectural apparatus for the cities. Since the eighties however, post Thatcher politics (i.e. the Empire) has been eroding the Commons. Today, the Commons we have left in our western society has a heavily transformed profile. In certain nations, as Italy, the phenomenon was particularly evident, as the investments on welfare had been drastically cut. No more social housing, no more schools, no more post offices, no more civic centers: the desert. In the far depths of the Even Covered Field, the suburban mall surreptitiously replaced some of the functions, as such becoming the only possible stage for twisted remnants of anything public. The reoccuring crisis of the current world-order asks urgently for a way out. Can architecture - common expression of power - enable such a rupture, or at least bring a contribution towards another equilibrium? We believe a possibility lays (again) in the formalization of the Commons. This year we want to investigate if the Commons can still be made and how they can be effective again. We will design where the problem is more evident, in the endless extension of the Roman periphery, a nasty by-product of failed utopias and criminal real estate investments, and in the northern periphery of Milan where the planned city morphs into the informal accumulation of wildly individual choices. In Rome, during first semester, we will unfold a possible narrative following the lines of the Appia, a remarkable axis radiating from the city centre and pointing towards what is left of the Roman countryside. In the second semester we hope to repeate this <squote/>trick<squote/> in Milan, using the Northern axis of Corso Sempione. In the tradition of the Modern, we will locate and design schools, post offices, civic centers, police stations and more, expecting to be surprised by the students even at the level of the program. Success is not guaranteed, but the stakes are too high to be ignored.","The Commons - part 1: Appia Novissima will tackle the urgent issue of rebuilding the shared infrastructure of the European territory, with the Roman periphery as its case-study."

In particular, we examine the potential of responsive morphogenetic design to explore intuitive form finding processes that address bio-climatic and socio-economic challenges. This studio (the ""Xixinan studio"") is the second in a planned series of design research projects focused on the theme of data-driven urbanism. While developing a base of digital evidence specific to each site, each studio will explore novel means of deploying this data to support design and generate form. The intellectual aim of the studio is to question the extent to which the data-scape can artificially generate urban form. Our interest is directed at the decoding and recoding of two distinct domains of knowledge: exteriority which represents a many-layered geographic condition and anteriority which represents the embedded knowledge of local architectural typologies and systems. While the exteriority of geographic data is crucial to our research, we place a primary emphasis on the generative potential of typology- what we have called ""growth typologies"".

The infamous scramble for Africa disrupted an entire continent introducing new cultural, economic, political and educational systems, with enduring repercussions. These thrusts propelled nationalist feelings and geographical conflicts over previously inexistent borders, with Morocco - standing at a geographical crossroads between Sub-Saharan Africa, the Maghrebi Arab-Muslim world and Mediterranean Europe - struggling to withstand the deriving cultural clashes. Post-independence Arabization tried to tackle issues of identity, but the clear Westernization of its cities and the new guise of economic imperialism - with the old colonial powers still dominating the trade balance - showcase an ongoing and unresolved conflict between past and present. Morocco<squote/>s recent development poses an additional threat: across the Arab world, the richest countries are the ones where traditional knowledge and urban heritage have been more quickly forgotten or entirely destroyed, fueled by an elite who still relies on western references as an alleged indicator of higher culture and education. The choice of Fez as a case study stems from its peripheral condition which explains its resistance to the liberal democratic transformations witnessed in other major cities. Fez<squote/>s medina - the vastest contiguous pedestrian area in the world - has managed to keep its physical conformation and original craft-based functions, continuing to be a productive habitat and the commercial center of the city. This is a showcase for how a self-built environment can still be used as a way to cope with modern life. The growth of the city and its new clusters furthermore allow us to investigate the difference between market derived urban poverty and rural poverty, demarcating the perennial validity of spatial values and vernacular construction techniques based on intuition (of which the courtyard house is the most prominent example). Fez<squote/>s case will be used to tackle the themes of ecology, semi-rural settlements, the privatization of land use, forms of production and the importance of typology as a way to create stable means of human association and community. Alongside a growing stream of large-scale international investment and the enticement of tourism, we are looking for tiny cues, nagging doubts and signs of the fusion between form and life, raising questions about identity, authenticity, tradition, the globalization of culture and the use of local resources.","laba<squote/>s focal theme is Urban Nature.

This mental act, not always logical, mostly driven by intuition, is also of paramount importance for our continued existence because - in an environment characterized by rationally operating computers and machines - it is this non-rational and elusive tactic that will offer and secure an irreplaceable place for us humans in future. The module will focus on working with experimental and visual compositional techniques. The main interest lies in the visual connecting and rearranging of what is seemingly incompatible, image constructions that have very little to do with reality, utopia in terms of content, composed however in terms of visual vocabulary mostly as photographs, thus apparently very plausible and realizable. The module offered is divided into two main parts. In a first part, the participants develop on the computer a series of unconventional image collages based on the new arrangement of found photographic image components. In the second part of the module, the focus will be on everyday objects surrounding us. On the basis of a &#8220<semicolon/>Grille de Lecture&#8221<semicolon/>, their characteristics will be determined, their function queried, and by means of using antonyms, they will be finally visually re-interpreted, modified and taken to their absurd conclusion. The course encourages the use of digital instruments in engaging at the very extreme limit of the interplay between reality and fiction.","Key competences for every architect are the ability to represent ideas coherently and communicate a project<squote/>s aims effectively. Design, painting, photography, modelling and graphics are essential to the architectural project and become didactic instruments for the development of individual talent."
49,AR-416,,UE N : Art et architecture: constructing the view II,"Visualizing Vagueness The image as a medium has always played an important role in architecture. The creation of architecture is always preceded by a phase of imagination, be it in the form of a sketch, a diagram, a plan or a perspective - abstract or not. Architecture has always been imagined and communicated by means of images and pictures. Today, digital image editing allows the creation of images which are nearly impossible to distinguish from a photograph. But what other image strategies and aesthetics can be pursued with the help of digital image techniques - image strategies which are not only aimed at the most exact realization of photographic rendition? The module will focus on working with experimental 3D rendering techniques. The main interest lies in the calculated visualization of vagueness and imperfection. Using the rendering programme Cinema 4D, students will develop a compelling series of images, ranging from two-dimensional image compositions to figurative and fictitious arrangements of objects. Students will be introduced step-by-step to the software and its possible configurations. The goal is to develop unconventional and experimental image strategies and aesthetics for architectural representation using 3D rendering techniques. The course encourages the use of digital instruments in engaging at the very extreme limit of the interplay between reality and fiction.","Key competence for architects is the ability to represent ideas and communicate a project<squote/>s aims coherently.

55,AR-430,Magma and principles,Magma et principes,"The course Magma et Principes tends to improve the transparency between laboratories by providing a platform for discussion and confrontation of various dialectical positions. The purpose of theses exchanges is finally to sketch an image of the architecture through its similarities and differences. The topic of 2015, ""CLIENTS"", will explore the different relationships that architects can have with purchasers. The theme was inspired by an older issue of the magazine ""rassegna"" of the 80th where the question was about the ""pencil"" of the clients in the work of Le Corbusier. This pencil sometimes opened up a visionary field or was more apunishing restricting instrument in the design process. Today there exists a huge range of varieties of client-architect relationsships from privat order, public, investor, prime contractors, etc.who needs each a very specific way of communication. This tour of Magma and Principes we will discuss this phenomenon of different connections. We will try toanalyse with stunnishing examples, the first contacts, the production process and the stage of the dissociation after the birth of the common result and observe thespatial and expressive influences of the process. The seduction and persuasions acts between the architect and his client is for Magma and Principes a specific issue where we think that between belly, heart and head there is a lot of important surprises to be expected. The contribitions of the professors should help students to develop an inspired and accurate work. Their task is to offer an authentic reflection in the form of concise illustrated text on the theme. The teachers involved in a contribution towards ""CLIENTS"" will be Kempe Thil, Bernard Cache, Vincent Kaufmann, Roberto Gargiani, Yves Weinand, Patrick Aebischer, Giuliani and Hönger, Andrea Bassi, Jacqueline Burkchard, Emmanuel Rey, De Vinck Tailleu and Bakker and Blanc.

58,AR-434,The preservation project: theories and techniques,Théories et techniques du projet de sauvegarde,"The course has two aims. To begin with, it will trace the evolution of the constructional systems characteristic of 20th-century architecture, dealing with key notions such as new materials, industrialisation of the building sector and how it transformed the process of building, and the artificial control of building services and comfort. This multidisciplinary knowledge calls for both historical research and detailed consideration of materials technology and construction practice as well as economic and environmental aspects. Critical-historical research and material analysis, based on the specific constructional identity of 20th-century architecture, demand ad hoc preservation strategies, developed using specific skills and with a firm grounding in theoretical discourse. Creating design tools - for both theory and practice - that take account of the particular issues surrounding modern heritage conservation is the second major objective of the course. By examining events that had particular importance in shaping the discipline, the theoretical basis for design within existing structures - for monumental architecture and ordinary buildings alike - can be tackled while also addressing operational issues and techniques for conservation-restoration. Throughout the semester students will consider the ideas that evolved during the 19th and 20th centuries that make up the history of preservation theory. This is not simply a matter of deepening one<squote/>s appreciation of the fundamentals of the discipline but also of stimulating a critical and consistent approach among students in their work to existing buildings.",Construction within existing buildings is nothing new. What gives it contemporary relevance is the type of theoretical and practical questions we have to pose concerning the architectural object and the close-range examination of building fabric that is involved.

75,AR-471,UE J : Territory and landscape,UE J : Territoire et paysage,"On the road. Towards a post-car Leman city Reducing individual motorized mobility is widely debated today in the context of environmental concerns regarding the issue of reducing emissions of polluting gases and managing energy resources. At the same time, social practices are symptomatic of a decreasing interest in the car: lower vehicle sales, decline in the percentage of young people who pass their driving license, etc. The reasons lie not only in a decrease in the purchasing power of individuals and greater value attributed to other consumer goods, but also in changing lifestyles. Our Teaching Unit will explore the future of urban space on the assumption that the trends outlined here could accelerate, culminating in the total elimination of the car. This radical hypothesis prompts us to reverse our perspective upon urban space. What would happen in a post-car world (http://postcarworld.epfl.ch) to the vast amount of territory now dedicated to traffic and to cars? What potential reuse will be made of countless square meters of roads and cubic meters of building that would otherwise be under-utilized, if not merely abandoned? What about the forms of territory that have been shaped by the century of the car? What about a new urban mobility that would combine short distance (walking, cycling) and commuter mobility? What new forms and dimensions of public space, what uses and atmospheres? The case study site chosen to address these questions is a segment of the north-east shore of Lake Geneva between the two agglomerations of Geneva and Lausanne-Morges, an area whose economic vitality depends on its attractiveness in terms of quality of life and job opportunities. If automobile traffic was a decisive factor for its development, it is now an obstacle, given the counterproductive effects of downturns and daily traffic jams. Will the city territory Leman, its character and qualities, be perpetuated beyond the terms established by individual motorized traffic? In order to make a proper territorial inversion, students will sketch a project in two stages: in reference to the concept of ""Porosity"", they will re-articulate networks of mobility on a portion of land 70 km long<semicolon/> afterwards, they will test the possibilities for reuse of car space at the scale of ""Proximity"".","UE J introduces students to large-scale territorial analysis through the investigation of a research hypothesis. A sequence of operations will be proposed: description, reading of spatial principles (rationalities and dynamics) and comparison of different urban conditions."
76,AR-476,,UE U : Cartography,"Cartography: Maps are visual tools for thinking about the world at many scales. They shape scientific hypotheses, organize political and military power, limit the boundaries of private property, and reflect cultural ideas about nature and the landscape. To the extent that our world-views inform our perceptions, maps have the power to actually make the territories they represent and construct the subjects that gaze upon them. Throughout Western modernity, cartographic reason has mediated this epistemology preponderantly. Cartesian perspectives lineated the world with respect to a fixed anthropocentric subject position and <squote/>God<squote/>s eye views<squote/> surveyed the world from an abstract elevated <squote/>nowhere.<squote/> Cartography became the enterprise concerned with the analysis and measurement of the res extensa, that is, the management of nature as resource and neutral background for architecture.

Environmental Objects: The word environment comes from the French environer, meaning <squote/>to surround, enclose, encircle.<squote/> The word object comes from the Latin objectum, meaning <squote/>thing lying before, opposite<squote/> the mind or sight. The environment is the milieu, the mid-space, the medium in-between. The object limits a place and occupies a position. To think of architecture as an <squote/>environmental object<squote/> means to question this opposition and thus disrupt the longstanding trope of architecture as the foreground of nature, the autonomous landmark dominating the land. To map environmental objects is to render visible the entanglements between architecture and its territorial environments, thus reimagining a discipline that amplifies its context, attunes to it and renders it conscious.","This teaching unit aims to experiment with the medium of cartography as a means of spatial representation, and as a tool for reading, understanding and changing the territory."

80,AR-485,,Political Economy of Design,"By integrating yet moving beyond the stylistic, technological or sociological aspects of the discipline, the discussion reviews the industrial elements that are likely to affect programmatic objectives, formal directions and technical outcomes of building projects. Such discussion has a strong comparative bent, and is coloured by the notion of innovation - what it means from a social, technical and cultural point of view, and how it enters and affects different building markets. Attention is directed at understanding the distinction between innovation on one side and invention and technological change on the other. In this context, architecture<squote/>s connection with planning and building disciplines is examined and criticised in the attempt to formulate a strategic framework for its use as an environmental policy instrument.","Political Economy of Design seeks to position and discuss architecture in relation to the world of production, economic interests and community benefits, at a local and global scale."

The approach will be based on a blend of theory and history, contemporary issues and examples borrowed from the past. The course will question the technological as well as epistemological foundations of the modern notion of structure. It will explore the various issues at stake in the diffusion of new materials in architecture. It will also pay a close attention to the way technology exerts an influence on the very definition of the architectural discipline. A series of fundamental evolutions will serve as the background of the lectures. For instance, the increasing tension between architecture and engineering throughout the 19th and 20th centuries will be repeatedly scrutinized. It will be argued that during the same period of time this tension has constituted a permanent source of architectural and technological innovation. The rise of the modern notion of structure will appear as another major thread. Its study will enable to grasp the full scope of its very recent demise in relation with the so-called ""return"" of ornament. Of special interest will be also the way static approaches to architectural objects are being constantly challenged by modes of thinking giving precedence to dynamic processes.

87,AR-526,Autonomous architecture,Architecture autonome,"Autonomous architecture: the work of Aldo Rossi In the first part of the course we will analyze the Italian architectural, political, economic and cultural context of the 50s .Then we proceed in the study of Rossi<squote/>s primary interests: painting, especially that of Cézanne and Sironi, literature, cinema and politics. Through experiments and lectures conducted by Rossi as part of its rapprochement to the Communist Party, we can understood his interest to neoclassical architecture and more generally for an architecture able to represent social values. The study of the work of Loos and Boullée, Ledoux and Lequeu - ""revolutionary architects"", as defined by Kaufmann - and the interpretation proposed by Kaufmann about the ""autonomy"" of the works of ""architects revolutionaries"" will be considered as a basic reference for the first significant research developments of Rossi. The reflections on the city and the book ""The architecture of the city"" will be analyzed in detail to understand the sources and more generally the interpretation of the city that Rossi offers in opposition to those given in other contemporary books. At the same time, the Rossi<squote/>s reflections on city will be studied to understand their role in the design of architectural projects, such as a school in Monza, the administrative center of Turin, the sports equipment in Abbiategrasso, the installation of park of the XIII Triennale of Milano, the Piazza della Pilotta in Parma with the reconstruction of Paganini theater, a place in Segrate and the district of San Rocco, Monza. The building for the district ""Gallaratese 2"" will be analyzed to understand how the principles of the Modern Movement are led by Rossi in his most ""exalted"" forms, basing that he himself defines ""rationalism exalted."" The competition project for the city in Scandicci represent a fundamental step in the course for which we will discuss the concepts of ""autonomy"" and of the ""analogy"".

89,AR-597,Superstudio,Superstudio,"The form of the contemporary city has changed and it finds also in Switzerland its specific configuration - a Gro&#223<semicolon/>stadt in formation - writes André Corboz in Vers la ville territoire in 1990. Today this city-territory, a &#8220<semicolon/>Horizontal Metropolis&#8221<semicolon/>, works as a spatial capital and as an agent of transformation, as a support and a place of potentiality. It is a layered territorial construction where agriculture and non-agriculture economic activities create an original mix. The HM is a natural capital as well as a spatial capital. This specific spatial condition has been the test case for the elaboration of original urban theories and is facing today new challenges, paradoxes and crises. It can also be, today, the support of an innovative urban and territorial project. Contemporary urban figures as Città diffusa in Northern Italy, Desakota in Asia, fine grain settlement dispersion in Flanders, or Zwischenstadt in Germany are just some of the examples able to effectively describe the emergence of acompletely new urban condition, increasingly related to the dispersion of the urban fabric in the agricultural landscape. The Horizontal Metropolis concept considers these figures beyond the center/periphery opposition revealing the dispersed contemporary condition as an asset - not a limit - for the construction of a sustainable and innovative urban dimension where horizontality of infrastructure, urbanity and relationships, mixed use and diffuse accessibility generate a specific habitable space. The radical nature of the change underway, together with the emergence of new urban paradigms, call today for a radical rethinking of the Western Metropolis idea and form. The Horizontal Metropolis concept represents an ambitious attempt to take on this challenge, at the global scale. Superstudio will investigate the Horizontal Metropolis, its space, its tradition, formation and authors<semicolon/> its relevance today as an energetic, ecological and social design issue.","Superstudio offre un<squote/>opportunité de travail sur un projet multidisciplinaire tres riche en données.

The chosen issue should remain students<squote/> chief concern throughout the statement, whereby students should clarify their standpoint, the central theme to be developed through their project and the underlying theoretical approach. Students should set out all issues, priority research angles and the methodological options adopted throughout the process. The statement should also delineate the space for study and intervention, the various work scales, leading to the project starting point and up to a possible feasibility study. Among requirements for the theoretical statement are documentary research, analysis and use of bibliographical, cartographic and iconographic sources and the development of a qualitative and quantitative plan. The document layout, quality of writing, and balanced, understandable and sensible presentation of texts and illustrations are also considered in the assessment of the theoretical statement.","The theoretical statement is the initial stage in the Master Project.

Students develop an architectural project related to the Theoretical Statement drawn up in the previous semester, so as to respond to the issues raised by the project plan. Engaged in a process of autonomous work, supported by the review group, students must assert their ability to connect theory and project, hypotheses and production, all types of constraints and the decisions taken at various stages of the project (location, implementation), methodology, objectives and results. The project is approached as research in a wider framework of reference, yet aims to provide a spatial answer to actual societal issues. Interdisciplinarity is encouraged through possible cooperation by lecturers from all EPFL fields of study, as well as the external expert, within the review group.","The one-semester Master Project is an architecture project conducted autonomously by the student.

138,BIO-493,,Scientific project design in integrative neurosciences,"Unraveling the mysteries of the brain involves exploring it at different scales and with different modalities whether this is in experiment, theory or simulation. While a faithful description at any single scale or modality may be already challenging, the most formidable aspects of this quest is how to do this in an integrative way. The students will form one team spending the semester together to design a scientific project demonstrating the bridging of scales and amenable to causal argumentation. The project can describe the design of an experimental, a modeling or a combined study. The primary goal of this course is to stimulate independent student thinking and to enhance problem solving capabilities. In addition, the course provides an important component of working together with other students as a team. Learning to organize team work and to recognize strengths of team members is therefore also a critical component of the project success.",This course will provide a forum in which students engage themselves in learning how to design a scientific project that bridges scales and allows following the causal chain from one scale to the next.

The importance of the local environment on dynamics at the molecular scale is introduced, and its influence on typical molecular-scale motions explored, including particle diffusion, the forces between particles in various media, and self-assembly of molecules into larger aggregates. Symmetric and asymmetric random processes are explored in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions, and the combined effects of symmetry, in the sense of invariance under an operation, and mass conservation, or the re-use of a limited amount of matter, are shown to constrain how molecular aggregates assemble, stabilise or disassemble. Computer simulations of simple model systems are used as examples for exploration in problems and a semester project. The primary goal of the course is to show students how nature takes advantage of symmetry and conservation, or selectively breaks them, to achieve specific cellular goals, and to understand how computer simulations can be used to study these processes.

This unique mixture of skills and personalities is required as these fields are at the interface between neuroscience and engineering. However, the daily rush to success, typical of modern PhDs, especially in the field of Bio&#8208<semicolon/>Neural Engineering, does not leave time to dig into the main neuro&#8208<semicolon/>scientific concepts and basic experimental tools. Questions like: * how electromyographic signals are generated at the level of the nerve muscle junction? * what is the source of Lead Field Potentials in the cortex? * how this knowledge can be used in the design of better prostheses or robots? would need a proper and diligent investigation.

Building a good system entails making the right trade-offs (e.g., between performance, durability, and correctness) and understanding emergent behaviors - the difference between great system designers and average ones is that the really good ones make these trade-offs in a principled fashion, not by trial-and-error. In this course we develop such a principled framework for system design, covering the following topics:","This advanced graduate course focuses on key design principles underlying successful computer and communicationsystems, and teaches how to solve real problems using ideas, techniques, and algorithms from operating systems, networks, databases, programming languages, and computer architecture."

We will study a variety of real-world problems on socioeconomic networks/crowds from the perspective of game theory, and develop the techniques required to rigorously analyze these problems."
543,CS-718,,Topics in Computational Social Science,"Data collected through digital systems, such as online social networks, search engines, mobile phones, apps, etc., offer great opportunities for addressing important research questions about individual as well as collective human behavior. Whereas such issues had previously been studied primarily by social scientists, the sheer size of modern social data sets, as well as the fact that they are produced within computational systems, requires computational ways of thinking about, and processing, them. The goal of this seminar is to acquaint students with some of the fundamental questions and techniques arising in the context of computational social science, e.g., - network analysis of social systems, - machine learning and data mining for social systems, - text analysis and natural language processing of social phenomena, - large-scale social experiments, - drawing valid conclusions from &#8220<semicolon/>found data&#8221<semicolon/> (a.k.a. observational studies), - integrated human-machine decision-making (incl. crowdsourcing), - algorithmic bias and accountability, - social information and communication dynamics (e.g., information diffusion), - ethics of computational research on human behavior. We will explore the above topics simultaneously in two ways: We will read the book &#8220<semicolon/>Bit By Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age&#8221<semicolon/> by Matthew Salganik (available online for free). We will read important research papers from computational social science that provide a deep dive into the topics discussed in the book. Every week, we will focus on one book chapter and one or two accompanying papers. All students will write a short summary and review of the respective paper, and one student will lead the in-class discussion. Beyond familiarizing themselves with research in the field, students will become better at assessing and critiquing scholarly work (by discussing and reviewing papers).","This is a seminar course. By commonly reading and discussing an introductory book, as well as important papers, about computational social science, students will become familiar with core issues and techniques in the field."
544,CS-721,Privacy at the communication layer,,"Often, privacy is understood as keeping data secret with respect to unauthorized parties. To achieve this one can use cryptography to ensure confidentiality, or modern obfuscation techniques, such as differential privacy, to prevent adversaries from inferring values in a database. However, recent events, such as the Snowden revelations, have made it apparent that privacy goes beyond protecting data at the application layer. To ensure users<squote/> protection, so-called meta-data, for example communicating partners and communication time or frequency, must be also protected from adversaries. The goal of this seminar is to provide students with the knowledge to understand the privacy threats related to metadata of communication, as well as give them tools to design and analyze protection mechanisms. Topics to be covered include: - Low-latency and high latency anonymous communication systems - Architectures and topologies: centralized, peer-to-peer, hybrid - Routing strategies - Dummy traffic strategies for creation and deployment - Protecting protocols - Censorship resistance Every week of the course, students attending the seminar will read one relevant paper on the topics above, and they will provide a critical summary (a conference review like). Then we will discuss the paper in group, with two students leading the discussion: one defending and one criticizing the paper. Once a number of papers have been read and discussed in class, students will propose a project to either attack or defend communication privacy which they will develop individually or in pairs.",In this seminar course students will get in depth understanding of mechanisms for private communication. This will be done by reading important papers that will be analyzed in the class. Students will also propose their own privacy attacks or defenses which can become a publication.

Such models are relevant to image compression, compressed sensing, and, more generally, to the derivation of statistical algorithms for solving ill-posed inverse problems. This course is devoted to the study of the broad family of sparse processes that are specified by a generic (non-Gaussian) innovation model or, equivalently, as solutions of linear stochastic differential equations driven by white Lévy noise. It presents the mathematical tools for their characterization. The two leading threads that underly the exposition are: * the statistical property of infinite divisibility, which induces two distinct types of behavior&#8212<semicolon/>Gaussian vs. sparse&#8212<semicolon/>at the exclusion of any other * the structural link between linear stochastic processes and spline functions which is exploited to simplify the mathematics The concepts are illustrated with the derivation of algorithms for the recovery of sparse signals, with applications to biomedical image reconstruction. In particular, this leads to a Bayesian reinterpretation of popular sparsity-promoting processing schemes&#8212<semicolon/>such as total-variation denoising, LASSO, and wavelet shrinkage&#8212<semicolon/>as MAP estimators for specific types of sparse processes. The formulation also suggests alternative recovery procedures that minimize the estimation error.

For more details, including table of content, see http://www.sparseprocesses.org/","We cover the theory and applications of sparse stochastic processes (SSP).

708,ENG-622,Science and Engineering Teaching and Learning,Science and Engineering Teaching and Learning,"There have now been multiple reviews of the implication of learning sciences research for teaching. While it is impossible to distil such a rich body of work into a few catchphrases, certain key features do emerge: 1. Learning is an effortful process, which requires the student to process information or to practice using skills. The goal of teaching therefore, is to facilitate student work. This implies trying to avoid learning situations where students are mentally passive (e.g. the traditional frontal lecture). 2. Students and pupils learn best when goals are clear, and when they get feedback on how well they are meeting those goals and how they can improve. In higher education the use of techniques like student response systems (&#8220<semicolon/>clickers&#8221<semicolon/>), on-line quizzes, and mid-term tests, can maximize ongoing feedback to students. Peer evaluation and grading rubrics can be used to help to clarify learning goals. 3. People learn best in emotionally secure environments in which they can try, make mistakes, and get feedback without being made to feel inadequate or ridiculed. There is also evidence that, in higher education, in classes experienced as emotionally safe by teachers, their teaching approaches become more student-centered and less focused on simply <squote/>transmission of information<squote/>. 4. Students learn best when they get to revise material over time. In particular, periodic low-stakes testing, and practiced recall have been found to have strong positive impacts on learning. In university contexts, where courses typically continue to introduce new material each week, mid-term tests and self-assessment quizzes can play an important role in ensuring long-term learning. 5. Students who are taught how to independently plan, monitor, de-bug and review their own learning, on average, outperform students who are not educated in such metacognitive regulation strategies. Students can be helped to develop this independence through the provision of clear learning goals, self-assessment activities, opportunities to review their own learning and chances to discuss their learning strategies with other students. While these issues apply across teaching and learning of all disciplines, specific isues arise in teaching science and engineering. The epistemologies of natural science disciplines are distinct from those in humanities and social sciences and these require teaching methods appropriate to these goals (such as, for example, inquiry-based methods, mathematical modelling of physical phenomena etc.). Engineering disciplines also have specific features such as the need to transfer analytical skills learned in classrooms into practice situations, and the key role of enginering design. Teaching science and engineering, therefore, requires pedagogies which are distinctive as well as evidence-informed. The goals of this course are: (a) To introduce novice teachers in higher education (doctoral teaching asistants) to these contemporary research-informed approaches to teaching (b) To provide opportunities for novice teachers to practice these skills (c) To provide a framework within which novice teachers can adopt research-informed strategies in practice, and can evaluate the impact of such strategies as part of a process of continual self-development. The course is organised in four parts: (a) lectures and flipped classes on research on teaching and learning in higher education (12 hours of class), (b) reading of research evidence on teaching and learning (9 hours of independent student work) (c) skills workshops in which participants can practice and get feedback (8 hours in class) and (d) the implementation of research-informed teaching approaches in a course on which the participant works, and the evaluation of this intervention (21 hours independent work). This course focuses on the teaching and learning of science and engineering in higher education and does not lead to a recognized teaching qualification for primary or post-primary schools.

715,ENG-632,Entrepreneurial Opportunity Identification and Exploitation,Entrepreneurial Opportunity Identification and Exploitation,"The choice of market opportunities for a new technology is one of the most challenging tasks for innovators and entrepreneurs, yet one of the most profound decisions in the commercialization effort. Therefore, if it is done right it can be a highly rewarding task - not only for the individual inventor and her or his team, but also for stakeholders such as future employees, the school, the region and the country. This course will focus on the process of linking technology to market opportunities. The goal of this course is threefold: (1) to develop a theoretical understanding of the process of market opportunity identification and evaluation in the context of new technologies, (2) to acquire practical tools for identifying, evaluating and choosing market opportunities for a core technology, and to apply this know-how to support EPFL inventors in their early stage commercialization efforts, (3) to channel back the practically acquired knowledge into theoretical conceptualizations of the underlying opportunity identification and evaluation process at the end of the class. The course will combine several learning methods: * Individual reading- to get acquainted with the core theoretical concepts and practical know-how underlying the market opportunity identification and evaluation processes * Class lectures - will present applicable business tools with detailed explanations on how to apply them, along with numerous examples and cases * Group work- to develop a promising strategy for a specific technology, and experience the early stages of new venture creation at first hand. Students will work on developing a startagy for teachnologies invented in EPFL. * Peer learning: to observe and learn from the other projects * Team coaching- to learn from experts and establish industry networks","This course focuses on the process of linking technology to market opportunities.

716,ENG-633,,Supervising Students in Projects and Labs,"Practical work is an important component of the scientific and engineering curriculum, most commonly in the form of practical sessions in laboratories and projects. International research recognizes the value of practical learning for helping students to develop a wide range of important skills including inquiry and design skills as well as transversal skills such as working in teams and managing projects. In engineering and sciences programmes, there is an increasing use of projects and labs to enable students to develop both technical and professional skills through complex practical tasks, frequently done in teams. When supervising practical learning activities, teachers and teaching assistants face numerous challenges such as: In addition, there is evidence that learning happens from undergoing practical work only if students are driven to reflect and step back from the task to think explicitly about the process. Efficiently supervising ""learning-by-doing"" activities in science and engineering therefore requires specific teaching skills applicable both to one-to-one interactions and to coaching teams. Using evidence from research in learning sciences, this course will introduce participants to teaching techniques that address these challenges and specifically apply to project and lab situations. Participants will get opportunities to practice these techniques on case studies and get feedback on their teaching skills. This course will include: Schedule:","In this hands-on course, participants will develop evidence-informed skills relevant to supervising and evaluating students working on projects and labs that are characteristic of science and engineering."

762,ENV-500,,Solid waste engineering,"With the third edition of Solid Waste Engineering, the authors have decided to expand this college textbook to focus on the worldwide problem of solid waste management. This change is illustrated by the addition of &#8220<semicolon/>A Global Perspective&#8221<semicolon/> to the title. Given that we are currently using our natural resources at an unsustainable rate, polluting our oceans and land with a variety of waste products and altering our atmosphere with gases that are causing further global warming, now is the time to educate future engineers with knowledge and tools to address these worldwide problems. The course is following the logic structure and the chapters of the book. The third edition has been rearranged to follow the hierarchy of solid waste management, reduce, reuse, recycle and recovery. Thus students will first learn about integrated waste management strategies, an expertise which will support the future engineer to take measures for pollution prevention as well as for resources conservation. In chapter 2 the students are introduced to municipal solid waste characteristics, including the identification of different waste components and materials. Component specific information is needed for recovery, separation and recycling of waste materials. The relevance of chemical, physical and mechanical properties are discussed in more detail as a basis for the chapters which follow. These properties are most helpful in order to identify potentially meaningful recycling pathways, as well as to decide about possible technological separation and purification options. The next chapter is dedicated to the collection of municipal solid waste, a key, but many times overlooked, component of integrated waste management. Following collection is mechanical processing, in most cases the necessary first step to the recycling and recovery of municipal solid waste. The students will then study mechanical, biological, and thermal processes. For each of these topics the authors have dedicated a separate chapter which will introduce the students to the basic principles of these separate disciplines in the context of waste management. Since not all waste streams can be recovered, students move on to residue management by combustion and landfilling. Finally students are exposed to the current issues in solid waste management and the principles of integrated and sustainable solid waste management. In a few cases the lectures at EPFL and the home reading will be complemented with field visits to waste treatment facilities.","The book ""Solid Waste Engineering - A Global Perspective"" is the basis for this course. This textbook is an excellent introduction to the field of Solid Waste Engineering and gives insight into relevant solid waste treatment technologies and practices."

Measuring the properties of the seasonal and perennial snow cover properties is therefore essential in understanding interactions and feedback mechanisms related to the cryosphere. Snow is a extremely complex and highly variable medium, and ali essential properties of seasonal snow cover are challenging to measure. Diverse fields such as hydrology, climatology, avalanche forecasting and Earth Observation from space benefit from improved quantification of snow cover properties, in particular related to the snow microstructure. The past 10 years snow science has seen a rapid change from a semi-quantitative to a quantitative science. Understanding physical and chemical processes in the snowpack requires detailed measurements of the microstructure. The Snow Science Winter School will teach these advanced techniques, as micro-tomography, measurement of specifie surface area by reflection and spectroscopy, near-infrared photography and high-resolution penetrometry. The laboratory measurements (micro-CT, thin section, fabric analysis) will take place in Davos. Every other year the course takes places in Northern Finland (Sodankyla), with the focus on field methods and the arctic snowpack. Target audience Any graduate student or post-doc workihg on snow or in sorne snow related field is welcome to participate.

932,HUM-340,History of economic thought,Histoire de la pensée économique,"In European policy circles, the role of social economy is often reduced to securing social cohesion. Far from being considered as a distinct sector, social economy is limited to employment policies. In this perspective, social economy is supposed to succeed when both the market and the State have failed. However, ""économie sociale et solidaire"" (ESS) has an historical connection with the 19th century answer to the <ladquote/> social question <radquote/>. In France, theoreticians often refer to Proudhon or Walras in order to establish theoretical legitimacy for their work. In the 90s a new type of entrepreneurship emerged in Europe claiming a filiation to social and solidarity economy. At the European level, a group of researchers has been recently formed (EMES) to analyze the emergence of this new network that promotes the combination of economic and social production of goods and services following various criteria: democratic governance, autonomy from the State, diversity of resources. We will highlight this kind of social entrepreneurship, aiming to avoid possible confusions with other ideological approaches of social entrepreneurship. A sound exposition of historical foundations of social economy is required to understand the issues at stake. Hence, we present them in the first part of our course. In the second part of the course, we also raise questions about the representations of society that actors promote in their practice of social economy. Indeed, an action can be evaluated by its consequences, or by analyzing the previous intention that led to it. Taking into account this difference, we try to identify the representations of the so-called social entrepreneurships. Their definition also depends on the country they belong to. In Europe or in the United States, ESS is linked to democracy or philanthropy at different levels. Therefore, it is important to present the criteria used to qualify social entrepreneurship and the cultural ethic it refers to. In this course, special attention will be paid to the democratic governance of ESS organizations. Some of the criteria for social enterprises are reflected in the European legislation on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and environmental standards, for which social enterprises are an appropriate example that could influence traditional organisations. Indeed, there is a link between social economy and sustainable development. Thus, we also address in the third and last part of the course the question of the fairness of wages in ESS<semicolon/> the different level of solidarity implied<semicolon/> and the financial aspects of these specific organizations that are some times confused with micro-credit enterprises. Three different specialists of the topics are invited to illustrate each of the three themes defined above. Both concrete examples and theoretical analyses are given together.

The discussion about the causes and the means of the affective power of ancient Greek music has been the main concern of musical topics for more than 18 centuries. During the Renaissance, composers and scholars writing on music increasingly bent their creative efforts toward the reconstruction of the technical conditions that were supposed to cause the marvelous effects of music on human soul, producing angry, fear, melancholy and even madness. Setting secular poetry to music, Nicola Vicentino, a well-known champion of this goal, wrote that ""the composer<squote/>s sole obligation is to animate the words and, with harmony, to represent their passions - now harsh now sweet, now cheerful, now sad - in accordance with their subject matter"". Nowadays, although no one questions the importance of the affections in the music of the Baroque period, musicologists have paid comparatively little attention to the practical aspect of this topic. Some years ago, a specialist like Georges Buelow, denied the existence of an Affektenlehre before the XVIIIth century, and defined it as an ""invention"" of the composer Johann Mattheson. But he was certainly wrong. An enquiry on the treatises and music of that period can show the existence of a substantial body of theory and practice concerning the emotional characterization of the elements of musical harmony : intervals, scales modes, keys, figures and rhythms, not only prior to Mattheson but even to Descartes, Mersenne and A. Kircher. Because these doctrines arise from a compound of disciplines -theory of proportions, harmonic theory, galenic theory of humors, verbal rhetoric - the study of this topic offers a unique opportunity for an interdisciplinary approach of music, history of science and humanities.

In this course we shall develop, analysis and apply computational methods suitable for solving systems of conservation laws. We begin by discussing fundamental properties of conservation laws, including their ability to general non-smooth solutions - shocks - from smooth initial conditions, leading to the introduction of weak solutions and entropy conditions. We initiate the discussion of computational methods by finite difference methods for conservation laws and introduce the concept of monotone schemes and the consequences of this.

This sets the stage for the introduction of essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) and weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) methods and their fundamental properties. Higher order in time is achieved through the development of strongly stable Runge-Kutta methods (SSP-RK). As a final extension to problems suitable for general geometries, we finally develop discontinuous Galerkin methods as a very general and robust high-order accurate extension of finite volume methods.

Then, starting from simplified problems, the equations are gradually extended to deal with multi-variate and multi-dimensional problems, and finally with the Navier-Stokes equations using the finite and spectral element method. The resolution methods for systems of linear and non-linear algebraic equations are presented with emphasis on their applicability conditions and algorithmic complexity.

1203,ME-372,Finite element method,Méthode des éléments finis,"Starting from the strong form associated to the problem of the longitudinal deformation in a uniform bar under traction and compression, the corresponding integral formulation and the weak form are first developed. The latter formulation is next discretised by means of the Galerkin method and the finite element method. Typical concepts like shape functions, classes of admissible functions, Hilbert and Sobolev spaces of functions or convergence criteria, necessary for the understanding of the approach, are briefly described, and the discrimination between natural and essential boundary conditions is discussed. The one-dimensional problem is then generalised by introducing various discontinuities (loading, section, material, etc) into the bar and the concept of higher-order finite elements is introduced. Following an approach similar to the one used for the one-dimensional problem, the course then focuses on the two-dimensional boundary-value problem of heat conduction on a surface. The corresponding weak formulation based on a scalar variable (temperature) is then approximated with two-dimensional finite elements. Lagrangian and serendipity, quadrangular and triangular, so-called master elements are developed and used for elaborating two-dimensional arbitrarily shaped finite elements (geometrically deformed finite elements). After a convergence study of the approximated solutions obtained with two-dimensional finite elements, an example of application is fully treated.","In this course, the student gets acquainted with the theoretical aspects of the finite element method, the most commonly used computational technique for solving elliptic problems.

This course is designed to study competition from the perspective of top management. A principal concern of managers is the relationship between a company, its strategy, its environment and the firm<squote/>s performance. This relationship is complex, uncertain, and always changing. Top managers shape and guide this relationship, making strategic decisions that change the organization<squote/>s capabilities, shift its position in the environment, or lead the firm into a new business. Consequently, this course has been designed to introduce students to the different aspects of strategic decision-making. For the most part, we will tackle the complexity and ambiguity of strategic decision making through discussions of case studies that provide rich descriptions of situations that are faced by real companies that either fail or succeed. In addition, various external speakers (company representatives) will discuss their company<squote/>s strategy and challenges with you. In class, I will act as moderator, questioner, and lecturer to help you gain a better understanding of firms<squote/> strategy, their formulation, and implementation. By actively participating in class discussions, you will sharpen your own insights, and those of your classmates.","Why are some firms more successful than others?This is the fundamental question of strategy.

1298,MGT-641(a),"Technology and Public Policy - (a) Science, technology and society","Technology and Public Policy - (a) Science, technology and society","Science, Technology and Society -- in short STS -- studies the interrelations between these three elements. In particular, STS looks at how economic, social, political and cultural conditions shape science and technology and how, in turn, science and technology shape society. STS has evolved over time and this evolution will be reflected in the course: from a purely historical approach in the early 1960s showing how technology emerged in particular societal contexts, STS focused as of the second half of the 1960s on philosophical and epistomological questions (e.g., scientific revolutions as taking place in a societal context). In the context of the social movements of the late 1960s, STS opened up to other disciplines such as sociology, anthropology and political science. More recently, STS focused more on helping scientists and engineers understand the social and political contexts in which their knowledge and technologies come to be applied. This course offers a broad introduction to the field of STS studies, by placing science and technology within their different historical and societal contexts and this from the perspective of how STS has itself evolved over time.

1391,MICRO-721,Advanced micro- and nanomanufacturing: top-down meets bottom-up,,"The course aims to present most advanced micro and nanofabrication methods that go beyond the well established techniques such as lithography and thin film processing. These new methods are emerging and are useful for PhD students to be aware of in order to design and fabricate novel micro and nanosystems, involving new, functional materials, and achieveing resolutions, shape and throughput that are of importance for the target application. Both techniques that are rather used as rapid prototyping as well as scalable method for high throughput manufacturing will be addressed. A list of topics that will be shown in the course is shown below. The topics will be updated in time to address also the most relevant and timely issues related to advanced micro and nanomanufacturing. Guest speakers from other academic institutions and/or industry will complement the lecture to give insight with first-hands experience to share with the students. In this first edition, following two experts have confirmed to take part: Dr. Massimo Mastrangeli (now Max-Planck, moving to TU Delft), Prof. Francesc Perez-Murano (CNM Barcelona) List of topics: Top-down fabrication: a) Fabrication through stencil, b) inkjet printing, c) micro 3D printing incluiding 2-photon lithography, d) (thermal )scanning probe lithography Bottom-up fabrication: a) principles of self-assembly, b) capillary self-assembly, c) fluidic self-assembly, d) capillary assembly of nanoparticles The course starts by presenting a map of currently available options for fabricating micro- and nanosystems, which includes both established techniques (electron beam lithography, nano-imprint lithogrpahy), covered in prior courses, and non-standard or advanced ones. This provides a recapitulative bridge to the students<squote/> background before focusing on the core of the course, which is the latter techniques. We then proceed by introducing the advanced techiques in details. For each technique, a brief overview about history and background theory is provided, before focusing on recent developments and applications. The relative place of each technique with respect to the map is emphasized, so that advantages, limitations and complementarities are evidenced. The second part of the course focuses on techniques that rely on the contactless and/or unsupervised placement of micro- or nanocomponents within a pre-existing templating substrate, i.e. where the structure arises from the directed organization of the constituting components - a family of approaches that can be broadly defined as ""self-assembly"". A theoretical framework inspired by equilibrium thermodynamics is briefly presented, before exemplifying three main applications within this family, namely: the integration of 2D microelectronic systems and self-folding of 3D MEMS by capillary self-alignment, the fluidic self-assembly of 3D systems including polymeric, liquid-filled microcapsules, and the topographically-templated capillary assembly of nanoparticles. Another topic of the course is a combination of top-down and bottom using directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers. It is emerging as a suitable possibility for high volume manufacturing of nanostructures and nanodevices. It is strongly being considered as a complementary nanopatterning technique by the semiconductor industry. DSA takes advantage of the properties of block co-polymers to self assembly, resulting in patterns with characteristic dimensions determined by the size of the molecules. In this way, resolution is only dictated by the molecular weight. It will be presented the main aspects of state-of-the art DSA including: materials, processing details, kinetics of self-assembly and applications. Special attention will be devoted to the creation of the guiding patterns that allows to position and orientate the molecules in the correct position.","This course introduces advanced fabrication methods enabling the manufacturing of novel and micro- and nanoscale systems.

Why do they adopt such complex fine morphologies? Is it possible to extract information on the parent phase from a completely transformed material? The aim of the course is to give the main elements of response: - The course will start by a global overview of the different microstructures resulting from a phase transformation in its broad meaning<semicolon/> which includes precipitation, order-disorder, twinning etc. - Simple notions of crystallography will be recalled: The crystal systems, the point and space groups, and the notions of holohedry will be shortly explained (or reminded). - Matrix calculations in direct and reciprocal space will be explained: structure, metric, correspondence and other transformation matrices will be detailed. The notion of coincidence site latice (CSL) and special grain boundries will be treated. - The geometrical notions of global/local symmetries and the related algebraic concepts of groups and actions of groups will be introduced with simple geometric examples. It will be shown that a generalized structure derived from groups, called groupoid, can catch the fascinating complexity of the variants. - Some characteristics such as hysteresis, reversibility, transformation plasticity will be considered in direct link with some crystallographic properties such as group/subgroup relation, lattice compatibilities etc. - These theoretical concepts will be applied to specific materials (precipitation in aluminium, martensite in steels, multiple twinning in copper) correlated to industrial problems. It will be shown how groupoids can be used to reconstruct the prior parent grains and quantify variant selection mechanisms. - Finally, brief examples will be taken from literature to show that groupoids are well adapted to treat many symmetry-related problems in physics, chemistry and biology. This course is intended for students or researchers in materials science. Chemists and biologists working on problems involving symmetries can also be interested in the general concepts. &#8194<semicolon/>&#8194<semicolon/>&#8194<semicolon/>&#8194<semicolon/>&#8194<semicolon/>","The microstructure of many alloys and ceramics are constituted of very fine intricate domains (variants) created by diffusive or displacive phase transformations.

1504,PENS-214,,Our common soil,"Faced with the constant growth of human settlements and increasingly threatening environmental challenges, the Swiss government has recently highlighted, through research initiatives such as the National Research Program 68, the urgency to consider soils as a resource providing a &#8220<semicolon/>wide range of ecosystem services&#8221<semicolon/> to both human and non-human habitats. In this perspective, the relation between the soil and the city needs to be rethought. Today extended urban formations characterized by a strong co-penetration of urban and rural realms characterize increasingly vast swathes of land all around the world and find in Switzerland a specific configuration. In such a new urban context, the City-Territory, the renewed ratio established between built and open space opens up a wide range of questions where the role of soil is increasingly crucial and strategic. In this frame, the course aims at: 1 - raising the issue of a necessary re-conceptualization of the existing relation between the city and its soils and 2 - question the paradigm according to which the city merely represents a threat for the natural environment. The instructors will explore, together with the students, the hypothesis of the &#8220<semicolon/>City-Territory as renewable resource&#8221<semicolon/>, able to work with and not against ecological systems. Even if still poorly taken into consideration, urbanized soils, that in some cases have proven to have higher eco-systemic values than even those of intensive agricultural areas, can in fact play a significant role in the management of urban ecosystems.","The course will explore the hypothesis of the ""City-Territory"" as renewable resource, able to work with and not against ecological systems.

Urban planning involves important decisions that have an impact on sustainable development. The consumption of non-renewable energy resources within buildings is influenced by the availability of natural resources, which in turn depend on the proximity of other buildings. Synergies can be obtained between them (heat expelled by a building can be used as an energy source by another) and between resources (heat and power can be generated from wastes). Urban planning also affects the habitat and the organization of public transportation and traffic within neighbourhoods and outwards. Economies of scale improve the sustainability of renewable energies as well as energy efficient technologies (cogeneration).

1636,PHYS-743,Parallel programming,,"This course is a two weeks long course. It is open to all the PhD students with a solid background in programming. The first week is dedicated to the theoretical concepts and practical sessions lead by teaching assistants. Starting with the concepts of the hardware of one node of a cluster (memory hierarchy, instructions, networking, etc..), you will learn how to debug and optimize a sequential code to be run efficiently on one node of a cluster. You will go through the entire Software Development Cycle loop (analyze - implement - debug - test) using standard GNU and proprietary tools (gdb, valgrind, gprof, Intel amplifier). Secondly, the two standard industrial parallel paradigms targeting the shared and distributed memory models are introduced: OpenMP (shared) and MPI (distributed). You will learn the basic concepts of the parallel programming. The goal is to learn how to choose the right paradigm for an application based on its needs. The OpenMP standard will be presented in its 3.1 version (without the hardware targets nor the SIMD constructions) from the basic loop parallelization directives to the tasks concepts. The MPI standard will be covered up to the standard 3. You will learn how to correctly use blocking and non-blocking point-to-point and collective communications as well as advanced datatypes, one-sided communications, dynamic process management and parallel I/O. Throughout all the first week, we<squote/>ll take practice the learned concepts by using a simple toy application: a 1D Poisson solver (using a finite difference scheme). From a fully bugged sequential implementation, you<squote/>ll optimize it, parallelize it using OpenMP and MPI to come up finally with an optimized hybrid implementation of the same solver. Please note that this course will not tackle the programming of accelerators such as GPU<squote/>s or Intel Xeon Phi<squote/>s. The second week is dedicated to a personal work on your own (or provided) application.
