## Calculating similarity between EPFL courses and using it to build a graph
* __Master's project at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)__
* __Author: Robert Injac__

In this project, I developed a method for establishing similarity/relatedness between two EPFL courses. I use this method to construct a graph of related EPFL courses. In the graph, the nodes are the courses, and there is an edge between two nodes if those courses are related. Visualization of the graph is available here (Code for visualization is not mine, see note on visualization below). The details of the similarity method used and graph construction are :
1. __similarity_method.ipynb__: pre-processing, establishing the similarity method, evaluation of the method
2. __creating_graph.ipynb__: using the method, graph creation

The notebooks contain description, explanations and comments along with the code.
